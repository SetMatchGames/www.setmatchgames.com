The best multiplayer games of the last two decades were designed by
players. MOBAs, Counter-Strike, and Battle Royals all started out as
mods. Set Match Games is building a platform that fully embraces
community-generated content, from game design and balance to art
assets and profit-sharing. Decisions about games will be made by their
communities, using
[curation markets](https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5)
and other forms of
[decentralized governance](https://medium.com/daostack/decentralized-governance-first-principles-1fc6eaa492ed). Game
clients will use
[gossip protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) to
connect players securely without any central servers.

We'll start simply with card games, but eventually, we hope the Set
Match Games ecosystem will support games of all genres and sizes.
