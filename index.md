# Background

Games are valuable, people pay for games.

Many games rely on the very difficult job of curating balanced formats. Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Dominion, League of Legends, and lots like them loose most of their value in an unbalanced or broken format. Balancing is very hard given the combinatorial nature of these games. The crowd of players have strong opinions about balance.

# Current Conditions

Game development companies do this curation internally and it often leads to controversy. It's probably an expensive part of the process that takes many people a long time before the formats are released.

Formats are not updated rapidly, they wait until the players have been given a chance to find strategic solutions to initially powerful strategies. 

# Goals

Increased variety and quality of game formats, game components, and rate of balancing unbalanced formats with a drastically reduced coordination cost by levoraging cryptoeconomic market mechanisms.
