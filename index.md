# Background

Games are valuable, people pay for games.

Many games rely on the very difficult job of curating balanced formats. Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Dominion, League of Legends, and lots like them loose most of their value in an unbalanced or broken format. Balancing is very hard given the combinatorial nature of these games. The crowd of players have strong opinions about balance.

# Current Conditions

Game development companies do this curation internally and it often leads to controversy. It's probably an expensive part of the process that takes many people a long time before the formats are released.

Formats are not updated rapidly, they wait until the players have been given a chance to find strategic solutions to initially powerful strategies. 

# Goals

- Increased variety and quality of game formats
- Increased quality of game components
- Increased rate of balancing unbalanced formats

# Analysis

- What are the bottlenecks in increasing variety and quality of game formats today?
  - Bandwidth for curation of the combinatorial explosion of component interactions. Why?
    - Not enough volume and diversity of people to search for broken interactions. Why?
      - Format curation is tightly controlled by the game publisher and done internally. Why?
        - There is no coordinating mechanism for format curation more efficient than the publishing company.
- What are the limiting factors in quality of game components?
  - see above...
- What are the bottlenecks for the rate of balancing an unbalanced format?
  - The inability for the publisher (balancer) to know if a balancing strategy for a particular overly powerful strategy exists and has just not been found by players yet. Why?
    - The publisher (balancer) is not the players. Why?
      - See above... (Format curation is tightly controlled ... )
  - The inability for the publisher (balancer) to know if the players want to keep searching for a balancing strategy. why?
    - see above...
